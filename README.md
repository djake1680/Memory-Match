#### Make a PULL-REQUEST for version .5.4 to your named branch on the LF c4_memory_match repo.

### Version 1.0
- Version 1.0.0
  - If the two cards match, apply some special visual effect, such as:
    - make the whole card disappear
    - highlight the card border in green
    - change the opacity of the whole card
  - if the cards do not match, flip the cards back
    - before you flip them back, perform an alert("They don't match") so you have time to see the cards before they flip back
      - We will do this in a better way later
  - reset your clicked card boolean tracker.  This will prepare your game for the next card pair click
  - add a 4th card.  This should give you 2 cards of each image.

### Extra for 1.0:
- If you feel bold apply a css rotation for the flip, look up CSS animations, specifically transform: rotateY
