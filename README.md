  - If the cards do not match, flip the cards back
  - Inform you when you have matched all cards, and ask if you'd like to play again

  - Accuracy counter - percentage of how many matches you make every 2 clicks

<h2>Things I have learned from this project:</h2>
  - Basic CSS animations
  - Different ways of calling functions (When I started this project, I used only onclick handlers in my html.  I later went back and added click handlers and click handlers with delegates to my javascript file).
